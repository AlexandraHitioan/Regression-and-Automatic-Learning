## General idea
This Python project uses the Least Square Method in order to solve regression problems on different sets of data.

## Goal
* Projecting self-learning systems: Creating algorithms that are able to train themselves based on the accuracy of past predictions
* Evaluating the created systems: Measuring the accuracy of the obtained results using performance metrics
